# CLI Solitaire using Java

## Overview
This project was created for CS3500: Object-Oriented Design. The focus of this course is to practice
following the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming and implementing common design patterns.

## Details
This project was an introduction to the Model-View-Controller architecture along with the delegator,
factory, and command design patterns. It also taught a valuable lesson in the importance of creating
abstract interfaces that only expose necessary methods. The program provides a textual view via the
terminal and allows you to play 3 versions of the card game Solitaire: Klondike, Whitehead, and
Limited-Draw. Each of the 3 use the same set of commands. The game keeps track of your score,
provides helpful messages after invalid moves, and automatically detects if the game has been won or lost.

This was the longest project I had ever worked on at the time. There were over 1000
lines of source code and documentation along with multiple thousands of lines of unit tests that
utilized mock classes and abstractions for terminal I/O.
